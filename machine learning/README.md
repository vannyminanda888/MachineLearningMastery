# 🤖 Machine Learning Cases
This folder showcases a variety of machine learning use cases implemented using Python scripts. Each case focuses on a different algorithm or modeling approach, highlighting practical applications of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

##🎯 Objective
To demonstrate the application of various machine learning models and approaches, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. These cases serve as a portfolio of my hands-on experience and problem-solving skills using core ML concepts.

## 🧩 What's Included
* 🔍 Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
* 🎨 Unsupervised Learning: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.
* 🗂 Classification & Prediction Tasks: With preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
* 📊 Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and more.

### Most implementations are written in .py files for modularity and clarity.

## 📁 Folder Structure
### Each subfolder contains:
* Python scripts for modeling and training.
* A dedicated README.md explaining the case context, objectives, and EDA findings.
