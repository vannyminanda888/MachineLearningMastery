# 🚀Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## 🎫 Goal : Will This Passenger Be Happy? Let's Find Out!

Ever wondered what makes someone love or hate their flight? In this project, I take on the role of a data detective 🕵️‍♀️, digging into real airline survey data to predict whether a future passenger will leave the plane smiling — or swearing never to fly that airline again.

The dataset includes feedback from 129,880 travelers, covering everything from legroom complaints to in-flight entertainment scores 🍿✈️. My mission? Build a model that not only predicts satisfaction but also reveals which flight features matter most to passengers.

Think of it as turning air turbulence into clean, predictive insights.
