# 🚀 My AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository! This space documents my hands-on learning journey across two major fields of Artificial Intelligence:

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Algorithms**

Each folder contains real-world case studies, model implementations, and insights I've gathered while exploring these powerful techniques. Most projects include `.py` scripts and Jupyter Notebooks, and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each case can be found in the respective subfolder's `README.md`.
