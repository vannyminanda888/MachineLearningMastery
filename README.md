# ðŸš€ My AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository! This space documents my hands-on learning journey across two major fields of Artificial Intelligence:

- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- ðŸ§  **Deep Learning Algorithms**

Each folder contains real-world case studies, model implementations, and insights I've gathered while exploring these powerful techniques. Most projects include `.py` scripts and Jupyter Notebooks, and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each case can be found in the respective subfolder's `README.md`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus

This repository is meant to:

- ðŸ“š Track my personal growth and understanding of AI topics.
- ðŸ§ª Showcase practical applications of ML and DL algorithms.
- ðŸ’¡ Provide reference code and ideas for fellow learners or collaborators.
